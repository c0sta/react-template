*** I'm using markdown "reference style" links for readability.
*** Reference links are enclosed in brackets [ ] instead of parentheses ( ).
*** See the bottom of this document for the declaration of the reference variables
*** for contributors-url, forks-url, etc. This is an optional, concise syntax you may use.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This boilerplate was build using [Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev/) because it's lighter than the usual [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/). Read [this](https://medium.com/codex/you-should-choose-vite-over-cra-for-react-apps-heres-why-47e2e7381d13) if you want to know more about.

## Built With

In this boilerplate I've added the base configurations for:

- ESLint +Prettier
- Commitlint + Husky
- Simple Docker compose configuration
- Simple CI pipeline to validate the pull requests on `development` branch
